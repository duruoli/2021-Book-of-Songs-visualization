# The Book of Songs Visualization

**Keywords**: JavaScript, digital humanities, visualization, interactive website

# Introduction
*The Book of Songs*, which stands as the oldest anthology of Chinese poetry, is highly revered for its cultural and literary significance. However, appreciation for this text has, for a long time, been limited to a small circle of experts and classical literature enthusiasts. It has become akin to 'high art' - inaccessible and esoteric. This barrier stems from difficulty of understanding classical Chinese literature.

Yet, the allure of *The Book of Songs* extends beyond its textual content. These poems vividly portray details of ancient Chinese life and the rich emotional life of the people of that era. There is the passionate pursuit of love, melancholic nostalgia for hometown, resentment against oppressive rule--an abundance of joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness. Simultaneously, the work employs a plethora of colorful rhetorical techniques and many exquisite, poetic metaphors, all of which contribute to the high aesthetic value of *The Book of Songs*.

The question then arises: **How can we enable ordinary people to appreciate the beauty of *The Book of Songs*?** 

Visualization is arguably the best method. By transforming the content into images, we can dissolve the comprehension barriers brought about by the text, allowing people to intuitively understand the poems' connotations, metaphors, and feel their elevated aesthetic value.

Our project pursues this very objective, conducting a content analysis on all 305 poems in *The Book of Songs*, including their themes, emotions, main ideas, and metaphor analysis, and subsequently visualizing these results by building an interactive website with JavaScript.

The part I am responsible for involves creating *Glyph* figures for the images, and *Sankey diagrams* for the content.

# Code
The complete project code is in the **master** branch. The major codes of the components are shown in "code-component" file in the **main** brunch, and the code of analysis of contents and metaphors is in the "code-analysis" file.
